Hey there!! I am Gabriel, aka Falcão, falcao_g or falcao-g :wave:😊

I am pretty much a life long learner. I enjoy the idea of **Learning in Public** where I can share my thoughts and knowledge with other people through live coding, blogging, discussions, threading, and open source contributions.

I have experience with Robotics, Automation, Bot development, Web development, and Back-end web programming. My main knowledge in technologies are **Python**, **Javascript**, **Node.JS**, **HTML/CSS**, **React native**, **Arduino**. I am also comfortable using **Typescript**, **React**, **Electron**, **Vue**, and **Dynamic Programming**.

My main abilities include designing and coding bots for discord, solving programming challenges, studying robotics and developing websites and mobile apps.

I'm currently studying Computer Science at UFMS
